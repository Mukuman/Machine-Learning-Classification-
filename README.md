# Machine-Learning-Classification-
In this project, I chose to work on a classification problem of predicting whether a credit card client will default or not. 
For this problem, I will use [Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset). In this data set, there are 30,000 examples and 24 features, and the goal is to estimate whether a person will default (fail to pay) their credit card bills; this column is labeled "default.payment.next.month" in the data. The rest of the columns will be used as features.
